Final Work - Web Programming Course
Enxurrada de Bits - CEFET/MG
Hi!
This site was made for the last work of the Enxurrada de Bits course - CEFET / MG.
The website is a fictional mini-store of food delivery services. A responsive website. Obs.:("I will not say fully responsive, because I tested only on two types of screens androids. ").

In the website's index, we have a small presentation with the company's logo and slogan.

In the "Home" tab of the site, we have the product area with interactions with items, add them to the cart, remove them and checkout.

In the "Information" tab, I left a place for the user to evaluate the system and services provided. As there is no backend in this application, without using a database, I left a way to store it in an array, which you can access through the developer tool in the "Console", type 'avaliations' and press the 'enter' key . The evaluations are only saved as long as the user remains in the "Information" tab, as I said, there is no database for him to save permanently.

In the tab "Trabalhe Conosoco", there is a small representative form, exemplifying an application for a vacancy in the company. Just as there is a storage array in "Information", I also left an array to store the form data. To access it, go to the console and type 'regs' and press the 'enter' key.

This was my work. Thanks!
